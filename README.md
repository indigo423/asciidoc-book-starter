# AsciiDoc Book Starter

This is a template repository for authoring books using AsciiDoc.

It provides the following features:
- Table of Contents (TOC) generation.
- Template prelude chapters: Preface, and Forward.
- Stock chapter templates.
- Chapters are structured into their own chapter directories so they can be co-located with their images and other assets, such as code snippets.
